### Common Issues

   - Ensure RLS policies are configured

3. **Reminders Not Sending**

   - Check cron job URLs are correct
   - Verify cron jobs are running
   - Check Vercel function logs for errors
   - Ensure USER_LINE_ID is set correctly

4. **Natural Language Parsing Issues**
   - Check command format matches examples
   - Verify time format is correct
   - Check for typos in task titles

### Getting Help

1. Check Vercel function logs for detailed error messages
2. Review Supabase logs for database issues
3. Test individual components (webhook, cron jobs, database)
4. Verify all environment variables are set correctly

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**

   - Never commit sensitive credentials to version control
   - Use Vercel's environment variable system
   - Regularly rotate API keys

2. **Database Security**

   - Supabase RLS policies are configured for user isolation
   - Only your user ID can access your tasks
   - Database credentials are stored securely in Vercel

3. **Webhook Security**
   - LINE webhook signature verification is implemented
   - Only POST requests are accepted
   - Error handling prevents information leakage

## Scaling Considerations

- Vercel automatically scales serverless functions
- Supabase handles database scaling
- Cron jobs can be upgraded for higher frequency if needed
- Consider implementing rate limiting for high-volume usage
