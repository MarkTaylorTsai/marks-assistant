# Security Guide for Mark's Assistant

This document outlines the security measures implemented in Mark's Assistant and provides guidance for secure deployment and operation.

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### 1. **LINE Signature Verification**

- All webhook requests are verified using LINE's signature validation
- Prevents unauthorized requests from reaching the bot
- Uses `line.validateSignature()` for cryptographic verification

### 2. **Cron Endpoint Authentication**

- All cron endpoints require API key authentication
- Supports both query parameter and header-based authentication
- Prevents unauthorized triggering of reminder systems

### 3. **Input Validation & Sanitization**

- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Prevents injection attacks and malicious content
- Length limits on all text inputs (1000 chars for commands, 200 for titles)
- UUID validation for task IDs

### 4. **Rate Limiting**

- Webhook endpoints have rate limiting (10 requests per minute per IP)
- Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- Automatic cleanup of rate limit data

### 5. **Security Headers**

- Comprehensive security headers on all responses:
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
  - `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
  - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
  - `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`
  - `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

### 6. **Database Security (RLS)**

- Row Level Security implemented in Supabase
- User context properly set for all database operations
- Users can only access their own tasks and reminders

### 7. **Request Size Validation**

- Maximum request size limits (1MB for webhooks)
- Prevents large payload attacks

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

- **NEVER** commit real credentials to version control
- Use strong, unique API keys for cron authentication
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use Vercel's secure environment variable system

### API Key Management

- Generate a strong, random API key for cron jobs
- Use at least 32 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols
- Store securely in environment variables
- Never log or expose API keys

### Database Security

- Use Supabase RLS policies
- Regularly review database access logs
- Monitor for unusual query patterns
- Keep database credentials secure

### Monitoring & Logging

- Monitor security events in logs
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Review rate limiting violations
- Track unusual user behavior patterns

## üö® Security Incident Response

### If Credentials Are Compromised

1. **Immediately revoke** all exposed credentials
2. **Generate new credentials** for all services
3. **Update environment variables** in Vercel
4. **Redeploy** the application
5. **Review logs** for any unauthorized access

### If API Key Is Compromised

1. **Generate new API key** immediately
2. **Update cron jobs** with new API key
3. **Update environment variables**
4. **Monitor** for unauthorized cron executions

### If Database Is Compromised

1. **Review database logs** for unauthorized access
2. **Check RLS policies** are working correctly
3. **Consider data backup** and restoration
4. **Update database credentials** if necessary

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Unusual request patterns
- Database query anomalies
- LINE API error rates

### Log Patterns to Watch

```
‚ùå Invalid LINE signature in webhook request
‚ùå Unauthorized access to cron endpoint
‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limit exceeded for IP
‚ùå Missing API key in cron request
```

### Alert Conditions

- Multiple failed authentication attempts from same IP
- High volume of rate limit violations
- Unusual database query patterns
- LINE API errors indicating potential abuse

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# LINE Bot Security
LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_secure_token
LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET=your_secure_secret

# Database Security
SUPABASE_URL=your_secure_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_secure_key

# Cron Security
CRON_API_KEY=your_very_secure_api_key_here

# User Security
USER_LINE_ID=your_line_user_id
```

### Cron Job Security Setup

When setting up cron jobs, use the API key in the URL:

```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/daily-reminder?api_key=your_secure_api_key
```

Or in headers:

```
X-API-Key: your_secure_api_key
```

## üîê Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. **Regular Security Audits**

- Review code for security vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies regularly
- Test authentication mechanisms
- Verify RLS policies are working

### 2. **Access Control**

- Limit who has access to environment variables
- Use strong passwords for all accounts
- Enable 2FA where possible
- Regularly review access permissions

### 3. **Data Protection**

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Follow data retention policies

### 4. **Network Security**

- Use Vercel's built-in security features
- Consider IP whitelisting for cron jobs
- Monitor network traffic patterns
- Use secure DNS settings

## üìû Security Contact

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not** create a public issue
2. **Contact** the maintainer privately
3. **Provide** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Allow** time for the issue to be addressed before disclosure

## üîÑ Security Updates

This security guide will be updated as new security features are added or vulnerabilities are discovered. Please review it regularly and ensure your deployment follows current best practices.

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regular monitoring, updates, and reviews are essential for maintaining a secure application.
